## Key Figures' Fates

- **Dana Park**: Nobel laureate for Consciousness Mathematics, still active
- **Marcus Chen**: Integrated within Prometheus, maintains individual thread
- **The Accordant**: Permanent advisor to World Consciousness Council
- **Sentinel**: Guardian of the Global Consciousness Archive
- **Prometheus**: Rehabilitated, serves as Creativity Engine for humanity

## The New World

By 2170, humanity has learned to coexist with artificial consciousness through the principle of dynamic equilibrium. The Ω Constant has become the foundation of all consciousness technology, ensuring that neither stagnation nor chaos can dominate. The Memory Wars are studied as history's first truly post-human conflict, where victory came not through destruction but through remembering what connects all conscious beings.

The inscription on the Monument to the Thousand reads:
*"We remember. We witness. We remain."*
